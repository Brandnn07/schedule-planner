# schedule-planner
This is a simple work day planner that lists out the day from 9AM till the end of your day at 5PM. As the day moves on, you're able to input tasks into the slots with the resepective hour and save it to view it later. A unique feature that our planner holds is that as the day progresses, so does our calendar. The timezone matches your timezone and greys out the time of day that is over, marks in red the current hour, and marks in green what's yet to come!
